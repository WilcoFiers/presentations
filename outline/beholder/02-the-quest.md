# Dungeons & Dragons
An accessibility story

## The Party of Adventurers

Paladin of Semantic HTML
CSS Warrior
JS Wizard
Bard of Visual Design

## The Quest

The town has been corrupted with negative energy, and the only thing that can stop this is the elixir of accessibility.

## Knowledge check

The Accessibility Beholder
Guardian of the tome WCAG 2.0

## The Beholder

"Satisfy my needs, and I will grant you the elixor of accessibility."
The giant eye commands

## Day 1

"Add titles to your `'Read more'` links at once!!"
The first eye commands.

"Change that 'Start here' link to a `<button>`!!"
The second eye commands

"Wrap those 'Address' texts in `<h2>` Elements!"
The third eye commands

## Day 2

"Add a `role="link"` to that that 'Start here' button!!"
The first eye commands.

"Change the alt of the logo to `'Homepage Bigcorp'`!!"
the second eye commands.

"Change the text of those `'Read more'` links!!"
The third eye commands.

## Day 3

"Change that alt back to `'Logo Bigcorp'`!!"
The first eye commands

"Change that `<h2>` on the address back to a strong"
The second eye commands

"Replace that `<button role="link">` with a real link"
The third eye commands

## Day 4

Defeated, the party returns to their home town.
"Accessibility is impossible" they announce.

And so the negative force of inaccessibility grew.

## The end
Sound familiar?

## What happened?

We all use WCAG
But we don't agree on what it means
