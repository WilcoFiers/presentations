Tome of WCAG,
Guarded by the Beholder of accessibility

## The Beholder

"Satisfy my needs, and I will grant you the elixor of accessibility."
The giant eye commands

## Day 1
{{
  "fragmented": true,
  "data-background": "img/beholder.jpg",
  "class": "darken invert"
}}

- "Add titles to your `'Read more'` links"
  *The first eye commands.*
- "Change that 'Start here' link to a `<button>`"
  *The second eye commands*
- "Wrap those 'Address' texts in `<h2>` Elements"
  *The third eye commands*

## Day 2
{{
  "fragmented": true,
  "data-background": "img/beholder2.jpg",
  "class": "darken invert"
}}

- "Add a `role="link"` to that that 'Start here' button"
  *The fourth eye commands.*

- "Change the alt of the logo to `'Homepage Bigcorp'`"
  *the fifth eye commands.*

- "Change the text of those `'Read more'` links"
  *The sixth eye commands.*

## Day 3
{{
  "fragmented": true,
  "data-background": "img/beholder3.jpg",
  "class": "darken invert"
}}

- "Change that alt back to `'Logo Bigcorp'"
  *The seventh eye commands*

- "Change that `<h2>` on the address back to a strong"
  *The eight eye commands*

- "Replace that `<button role="link">` with a real link"
  *The ninth eye commands*

## Day 4
{{
  "fragmented": true,
  "data-background": "img/dnd-inn.jpg",
  "class": "darken invert"
}}

Defeated, the party returns to their home town.
"Accessibility is impossible" they announce.

And so the negative force of inaccessibility grew.

## The end
{{
  "fragmented": true,
  "data-background": "img/dnd-inn.jpg",
  "class": "darken invert"
}}

Sound familiar?

## What happened?

We all use WCAG
But we don't agree on what it means
