# ACT Task Force
Accessibility Conformance Testing

## Rules

Describe how we test,
in a way that is:
- Consistent
- Understandable
- WCAG or other

And where possible:
- Automatable

----

Part of the WCAG Working Group,
Tasked to develop:

1. Common format for rules
2. Accuracy test for rules
3. WCAG Rules repository

## ACT Framework

- Usable by tools and in QA
- Adjust over time, understand assistive technologies
- Common output format
- Tested for accuracy

## Timeline

- 2017: Draft ACT Framework
- 2018: Test implementation of rules
- 2019: Public rule repository

## But wait, WCAG Techniques?

Techniques are for developers,
what rules will be for testers.

- Don't require WCAG Expertise
- Change as technologies do
- Non-exhaustive
