The power of the Web is in its universality. Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect.

*Sir Tim Berners-Lee*, inventor of the World Wide Web

## It's about people 
We are all different
- Young and old
- At home or on the go
- Bored or in a hurry
- On a 10 mbit line, or a 2g data plan
