}}
---
Based on project management model
Came about in the 70's and 80's

### Organized into clear phases {{ "fragmented": true }}
- Requirements
- Design
- Implementation
- Testing

----
**Resulting in:**
- Specialized teams
- Sequential development
- Bigger projects

---- {{ "fragmented": true }}

Turns out software projects are hard
Definition and documentation up front
However:
- Requirements change
- Users don't know what they want

---- {{ "fragmented": true }}

**Waterfall problems:**
- Requirement changes are costly
- Going back was often impossible, as the team that could do the change was already on to the next project.
- Silo thinking, a focus on meeting ones own goals over end product quality
- Most software projects are very much unique

Came around the 2000's
Manifesto for Agile Software Development, 2001

---- {{ "fragmented": true }}
**How agile differs**
- Less up front planning, less documentation
- Multi-disciplinary teams
- Close involvement of customers

----
Adaptive process
Discover what to make, as you are making it
Short iterations and frequent releases

### The Scrumm method
- Daily stand up
- Product backlog
- Sprints

## Quality management
| Waterfall             | Agile				|
|-----------------------|-------------------|
| Dedicated teams       | Self tested		|
| Long test phases      | Frequent Testing	|
| Requirements up front | Specify as you go	|
