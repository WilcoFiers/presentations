# Development strategies

## Project management history

### In the olden times
Originally managed by a single person
- master builder
- creative architect
- etc

## Projects mid 20th century
First management tools developed in the 50's and 60's
Goal: grip on projects to manage risks
Have a predictable outcome

}}

Based on project management model
Came about in the 70's and 80's

--- {{ "fragmented": true }}
Organized into clear phases
- Requirements
- Design
- Implementation
- Testing

---
Specialized teams
Sequential development
Long development cycles

Turns out software projects are hard
Definition and documentation up front
However:
- Requirements change
- Users don't know what they want

--- {{ "fragmented": true }}
**Waterfall problems:**
- Requirement changes are costly
- Going back was often impossible, as the team that could do the change was already on to the next project.
- Silo thinking, a focus on meeting ones own goals over end product quality
- Most software projects are very much unique

**How agile differs**
- Less up front planning, less documentation
- Multi-disciplinary teams
- Close involvement of customers

---
Adaptive process
Discover what to make, as you are making it
Short iterations and frequent releases

### The Scrumm method
- Daily stand up
- Product backlog
- Sprints
