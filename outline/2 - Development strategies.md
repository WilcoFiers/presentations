## Waterfall model

Based on project management model
Came about in the 70's and 80's

---
Organized into clear phases
- Requirements
- Design
- Implementation
- Testing

---
By specialized teams
Sequential of development
Long development cycles

---
Turns out software projects are hard
Definition and documentation up front
However:
- Requirements change
- Users don't know what they want

---
This made requirement changes costly
Going back was often impossible, as the team that could do the change was already on to the next project.
Silo thinking, a focus on meeting ones own goals over end product quality
Most software projects are very much unique

---
Douglas Crockford "Programing is not manufacturing, it's discovery"


## Agile Development
---
Came around the 2000's
Manifesto for Agile Software Development, 2001

---
Less up front planning, less documentation
Multi-disciplinary teams
Close involvement of customers
Scrum, popular implementation of Agile

---
Adaptive process
Discover what you are supposed to make, as you are making it
Focused on short iterations
Focus on frequent releases

---
Daily scrum / stand up
Product backlog
Sprints
Requires close interaction
