# Accessibility Strategies

## Waterfall Accessibility

Accessibility requirements up front
Accessibility testing during the test phase
Accessibility experts focus on audits

---
Strong reliance on designers and developers to get accessibility right
Problematic as issues are caught very late
Test at each milestone
Testing done by dedicated test team

Benefits
- Clear requirements up front
- Long term test plan
- Dedicated test experts


## Agile Accessibility

No more strict requirements up front
No long term test plans
Quality managed by automated testing

---
Iterative development leads to:
- More frequent testing
- Which requires test automation over manual testing

---
In waterfal: Testing for a month, to release once a year
Agile: Release every month, test every sprint

---
Testing done by the development team.
Strong emphases on automated testing.
QA teams start to disappear
And each team becomes responsible for the accessibility of their product

---
But where do they get their expertise?
An accessibility expert in every team?
Far too expensive

---
Instead, we got dedicated accessibility teams
To oversee the accessibility of releases of many other teams.
And to make teams **mostly** self sufficient in managing accessibility
