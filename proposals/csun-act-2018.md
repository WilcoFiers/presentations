# {{ Presentation title }}

The Accessibility Conformance Testing Taskforce (ACT TF) was spun off of the W3C's Accessibility Guidelines Working Group in 2016, with the goal to develop an approach to harmonize web accessibility testing. The backbone of this work is the ACT Rules Format, a future W3C recommendation, which will formalize how to document the rules used in accessibility testing.

Building on this Rules format, the ACT Taskforce is developing several new and exciting products, which will significantly change how accessibility testing will be done in the future. During the presentation, the chairs of the ACT Taskforce will showcase these new products:

- The ACT Rules Format
- The ACT Rules for accessibility testing
- The Test case repository

## The ACT Rules Format

The ACT Rules format is a future W3C recommendation developed by the ACT Taskforce. It outlines how to write accessibility testing procedures (ACT Rules) in a way that is understandable, consistent and accurate. By having a common format to use, organizations can start exchanging their rules and building a centralized approach. Rather than each organization having to develop their own, the ACT Rules format allows us to build on each others experience and develop test rules better than any individual organization could have developed.

We will look at some of the experiences ACT TF members have had working with the draft of the ACT Rules format, and discuss with the audience how they might be able to use the ACT Rules format in their own organizations.

## ACT Test Case Repository

As a first step to harmonization, the ACT Taskforce has recognized that many accessibility tool developers have developed their own set of test cases. Developing test cases is common in any software development process, so there is no surprise there. The ACT Taskforce is looking to bring some of these publicly available test case repositories together, into one large repository of accessibility test cases.

We will show the format we have developed for this repository. This will allow each organization to maintain their own test cases, while exposing a single file that outlines how to consume that particular set of test cases. Instead of having a few hundred test cases for their own tool, this combined repository will have thousands of test cases with accessibility passes and failures. Any accessibility test tool will be able to run against all of these test cases, and thus learn from all of the edge cases other tool developers have already encountered.

## The WCAG ACT Rules

With the previous pieces in place, we can put the final part in. The WCAG ACT Rules. The ACT Rules developed by different organizations will be collected, verified for their quality, and published by the W3C. This repository of Rules will do for Accessibility testing what the WCAG 2 techniques did for accessible development.

The WCAG Techniques are documented ways developers can make something accessible, and thus pass WCAG. This is a great help in teaching developers the best ways to approach certain accessibility questions. The WCAG ACT Rules will be documented ways that accessibility testers can use to test for WCAG violations. Similar to the WCAG Techniques, the WCAG ACT Rules are non-exhaustive. Meaning that there are certainly other rules that you could write to test particular WCAG violations. There are already several example rules out there, which we will show as examples.

## What is next?

We will conclude the presentation by talking about what we think will be next for the ACT Taskforce. We'll look at the process of getting the Rules Format to the Recommendation stage. We will talk about how we will develop the initial set of rules for the WCAG Rules Format, and together with the audience, we will explore some of the ideas we have on how we can maintain and improve the WCAG ACT Rules better over time.
